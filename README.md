# Project Website

Welcome to my project website! This site is a personal space where I experiment with coding and build various projects to improve my skills. It serves as a learning hub where I can practice different web development techniques while showcasing my progress over time.

## Purpose
- To improve my coding skills by working on real projects.
- To explore different web development technologies and concepts.
- To document my learning journey and track my progress.
- To create a portfolio of projects that can be expanded over time.

## What to Expect
This website will feature a variety of projects, including but not limited to:
- Small coding challenges and exercises
- Web development experiments
- Interactive tools and utilities
- Game development prototypes

Each project will be unique, and the site will evolve as I learn and improve. Some projects may be fully functional, while others will be experimental and in-progress.

## Technologies Used
I will be using a mix of different web development tools, including:
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web development
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- GSAP for animations
- SASS for advanced CSS styling (in the future)

This website will not use a framework initially but may integrate one later as I gain more experience.

## Future Plans
As I continue to learn, I plan to:
- Expand the website with more features and functionality.
- Improve the design and user experience.
- Document each project with detailed explanations and source code.

## Get in Touch
If you have any feedback, suggestions, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out!
